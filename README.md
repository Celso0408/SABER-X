## Synchrotron XAS (reference spectrum libraries)

* **RefXAS (DAPHNE4NFDI)** – open database with QC’d XANES/EXAFS + metadata; actively maintained with FAIR principles. ([xafsdb.ddns.net][5])
* **CLS XASDB** – Canadian Light Source’s open XAS database (periodic-table browser; batch plotting & downloads). ([xasdb.lightsource.ca][6])
* **SSRL XAFS Library** – long-standing reference library (mostly transmission EXAFS/XANES). ([www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu][7])
* **IXAS / Farrel Lytle EXAFS archive** – historical EXAFS scans curated by IXAS. ([ixs.iit.edu][8])

## Synchrotron diffraction / total scattering (examples & portals)

* **PaNOSC portal** – find HR-XRD, GI(W)AXS, and **PDF** (total scattering) datasets across facilities via a single search. ([data.panosc.eu][1])
* **MDF example** – SrTiO₃ 3D microstructure (HEDM) datasets from APS (with metadata & access instructions). ([acdc.alcf.anl.gov][4])

## Combined XAS + XRD datasets (same specimens)

* **Arsenic minerals (28 species)** – CLS **XAS (As K)** + **XRD** reference set (open via FRDR; described in Data in Brief). Ideal for LCF and cross-technique validation. ([frdr-dfdr.ca][9])
* **Molybdenum minerals (15 species)** – CLS **XAS (Mo K & LIII)** + **XRD** dataset (open via FRDR; Data in Brief). ([frdr-dfdr.ca][10])

## Benchtop (lab) X-ray datasets

* **opXRD – Open Experimental Powder X-ray Diffraction Database** – the largest open collection of **experimental** pXRD diffractograms (single/multiphase; powders & some thin films). Great for ML benchmarking and reference matching. ([advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com][11])
* **Materials Cloud Archive (selected records)** – many community-contributed archives include **lab XRD** alongside synchrotron data; searchable by material (e.g., SrTiO₃). ([archive.materialscloud.org][12])
* **NOMAD Repository (experimental domain)** – FAIR repository hosting **experimental** materials data (including XRD/XPS etc.) with structured metadata and search. ([nomad-lab.eu][13])

---

### Notes

* Most portals above provide **DOIs**, standardized **metadata**, and bulk download options (e.g., **Globus** for FRDR). ([frdr-dfdr.ca][3])
* For pipeline building (e.g., Rietveld + PDF + EXAFS), a good pattern is: **PaNOSC** for synchrotron raw data → **opXRD** for benchtop references → **RefXAS/XASDB** for reference spectra. ([data.panosc.eu][1])
